# Project Overview

## Project Name
Railway Freight Car Routing Delay Prediction System

## Purpose
This is a comprehensive data science project template based on the cookiecutter-data-science structure. It provides a standardized framework for data science projects with:
- Organized directory structure
- Automated environment setup
- DataCatalog system for file management
- Pre-configured notebook templates
- Comprehensive utility functions

The project focuses on Railway Freight Car Routing and Delay Prediction, using this data science template as its foundation.

## Tech Stack

### Core Python Stack
- **Python**: Managed via Miniconda/conda environments
- **Core Libraries**: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (imported via preamble.py)
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, statsmodels
- **Visualization**: plotly, seaborn, matplotlib
- **Development**: Jupyter notebooks, ipykernel

### Key Components
- **DataCatalog System**: Automatic file discovery and smart data loading (CSV, Excel, JSON, Pickle, Parquet, HDF5)
- **Preamble Module**: Standard imports and path management
- **Helpers Module**: Utility functions for data manipulation, visualization, and file operations

## Project Type
Data science research project - not a deployable application. Focus is on reproducible data science workflows and analysis.
